// Multithreads and threads 

// Processes are containers that have blocks of code. 

// When a function inside a thread obj creation (new Thread(funct 1)) is executed there is created a thread with a call stack (like a queue)

// Cycle : Process -> Code -> Thread 1 (with callstack) -> Thread 2(with callstack) 

// Threads are independent of eachother, allow us to code async by putting a new thread
